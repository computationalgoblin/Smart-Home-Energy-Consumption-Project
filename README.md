## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Uncover Consumption Patterns**: Identify and understand energy consumption patterns and their correlations with other variables.
2. **Deploy Machine Learning Models**: Use identified patterns to deploy models that automate decisions and optimize consumption.

### Sub-goals

1. Conduct in-depth exploratory analysis of the dataset.

3. Perform feature engineering to enhance predictive capabilities.
4. Refine and specify goals based on analysis insights.

## Observations

- **Outliers**: Present in general energy usage, energy generation, and individual devices, suggesting event-based usage.
- **Energy Generation**: More stable compared to usage fluctuations.
- **Disparity**: Total energy usage does not match the sum of consumption from individual devices, likely due to non-smart devices.

### Impact

- **Outliers**: Significant impact on overall consumption.
- **Total Usage vs. Device Consumption**: High correlation with the presence of outliers.

## Analysis Insights

- **Time**: No significant correlations with day or minute variables, but slight correlations with specific times of the day.
- **Energy**: Furnace usage correlates with overall consumption. Some devices show associations with outliers.
- **Weather**: Apparent temperature aligns with actual temperature. Dew point correlates with temperature.

### Energy and Weather Correlations

- **Temperature-related Variables**: Correlate with devices like the furnace and fridge.
- **Monthly Variations**: Align with expected meteorological patterns.

## Conclusions and Further Goals

1. Develop an autoregressive model for predicting total energy consumption.
2. Incorporate and engineer relevant meteorological features.
3. Implement anomaly detection algorithms to optimize usage.
4. Continuously refine project objectives based on ongoing analysis.

## Univariate Time-Series Prediction

### Stationarity and Seasonality

- **ADF Test**: Indicates data is stationary.
- **Seasonality**: Suggested by residual component and trend of the seasonal decomposition test.

### Model Implementation

- **ARIMA Model**: Poor predictive performance with simple lags.
- **Seasonal ARIMA**: Better fit but poor predictive performance for future values.
- **Prophet**: Incorporates meteorological variables but struggles with trend fitting.

## Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Model

The LSTM model captures long-term dependencies in time series data. Incorporating meteorological variables enhances predictive capabilities.

- **R² Score**: 0.500, suggesting moderate accuracy.
- **Enhanced Model**: Improved performance with additional variables, achieving an R² score of 0.937794.

## Anomaly Detection

The ChangeFinder model detects abrupt changes in time series data, identifying unusual consumption behaviors for optimization.

## Conclusion

This project has provided valuable insights into energy consumption patterns and their relationship with meteorological variables. Through data analysis and modeling techniques, we have identified the impact of outliers on overall consumption and proposed proactive measures for optimization. Leveraging LSTM networks and anomaly detection with the ChangeFinder model, we've successfully developed predictive models capable of capturing complex consumption behaviors and external influences.

Moving forward, these findings pave the way for more efficient energy management strategies, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and drive tangible cost savings. By integrating anomaly detection algorithms into real-time monitoring systems, we can proactively identify irregular consumption patterns, mitigate wastage, and optimize resource allocation. Continuous refinement and iteration based on insights gained from ongoing data analysis will ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of our energy optimization efforts.

Ultimately, this project underscores the power of data-driven approaches in shaping a more sustainable and efficient future, where smart energy management plays a crucial role in mitigating environmental impact and driving economic efficiency.
