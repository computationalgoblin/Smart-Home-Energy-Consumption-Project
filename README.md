## Introduction
In recent years, we have witnessed a notable surge in energy consumption, leading to significant economic wastage and raising concerns about long-term environmental consequences. This trend prompts several critical questions: What are the environmental impacts? How does it affect the economy? How can we ensure sustainable energy usage?

Fortunately, the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) offers a promising opportunity to address these challenges by providing high-quality data that can detect and analyze consumption patterns with high granularity.

This project explores whether we can optimize energy consumption using IoT data through advanced data science techniques. Our key goals include forecasting energy usage and detecting anomalies to proactively manage irregular consumption, providing a foundation for developing real-time monitoring tools.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Uncover Consumption Patterns**: Identify and understand energy consumption patterns and their correlations with other variables.
2. **Deploy Machine Learning Models**: Use identified patterns to deploy models that automate decisions and optimize consumption.

### Sub-goals
1. Conduct in-depth exploratory analysis of the dataset.
2. Implement a baseline time series model to predict total consumption.
3. Perform feature engineering to enhance predictive capabilities.
4. Refine and specify goals based on analysis insights.

## Observations
During the exploratory data analysis, several observations were made:

- **Outliers**: Present in general energy usage, energy generation, and individual devices, suggesting event-based usage.
- **Energy Generation**: More stable compared to usage fluctuations.
- **Disparity**: Total energy usage does not match the sum of consumption from individual devices, likely due to non-smart devices.

### Impact
- **Outliers**: Significant impact on overall consumption.
- **Total Usage vs. Device Consumption**: High correlation with the presence of outliers.

## Analysis Insights
Our analysis revealed several key insights:

- **Time**: No significant correlations with day or minute variables, but slight correlations with specific times of the day.
- **Energy**: Furnace usage correlates with overall consumption. Some devices show associations with outliers.
- **Weather**: Apparent temperature aligns with actual temperature. Dew point correlates with temperature.

### Energy and Weather Correlations
- **Temperature-related Variables**: Correlate with devices like the furnace and fridge.
- **Monthly Variations**: Align with expected meteorological patterns.

## Conclusions and Further Goals
Based on our findings, we propose the following steps:

1. Develop an autoregressive model for predicting total energy consumption.
2. Incorporate and engineer relevant meteorological features.
3. Implement anomaly detection algorithms to optimize usage.
4. Continuously refine project objectives based on ongoing analysis.

## Conclusion
This project has provided valuable insights into energy consumption patterns and their relationship with meteorological variables. Through data analysis and modelling techniques, we have identified the impact of outliers on overall consumption and proposed proactive measures for optimization. Leveraging LSTM networks and anomaly detection with the ChangeFinder model, we've successfully developed predictive models capable of capturing complex consumption behaviours and external influences.

Moving forward, these findings pave the way for more efficient energy management strategies, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and drive tangible cost savings. By integrating anomaly detection algorithms into real-time monitoring systems, we can proactively identify irregular consumption patterns, mitigate wastage, and optimize resource allocation. Continuous refinement and iteration based on insights gained from ongoing data analysis will ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of our energy optimization efforts.

Ultimately, this project underscores the power of data-driven approaches in shaping a more sustainable and efficient future, where smart energy management plays a crucial role in mitigating environmental impact and driving economic efficiency.
